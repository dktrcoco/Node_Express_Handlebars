## Story

AS a food connoisseur, I want to be able to view types of burgers, listed between eaten and not eaten, allowing for moving burgers from the eaten list to the uneaten list 
So that I can view and track burgers I've eaten and want to eat

GIVEN a Heroku-deployed app that has database-stored data

WHEN I run the app

THEN I see the landing page for an app that tracks different burgers and whether or not they've been devoured

WHEN I submit a new type of burger

THEN that burger is displayed in the 'Not Devoured' list

WHEN I click the 'Devour it!' button

THEN that burger is displayed in the 'Devoured' list
